<h2><strong>When</strong> did you first notice,

What makes you feel older? Is it losing your youthful exuberance, energy and endurance? Perhaps it was when you started having trouble keeping up at work because your concentration was slipping. Or when you realized that you couldn’t move freely enough any longer to enjoy exercise, sports or playing with your grandchildren.

For others, growing older means not looking and feeling as youthful, useful and vital as in years gone by. Maybe you’ve reached an age when you wished you had more time to accomplish your goals, do volunteer work or travel. Whatever aspect of aging you may identify with, it’s a fact of life we all dread.

<h2>Decades after Nobel Prize is awarded, <strong>blockbuster discovery</strong> is made.</h2>
This unlikely discovery began quietly decades ago when three researchers discovered a new molecule (known as the “hidden vitamin” or “miracle molecule”) called "Nicotinomide Riboside" or Niagen (NR) for short. As fascinating as the discovery was at the time, it lay dormant until recently when the true treasures of Niagen were uncovered. After lying dormant in the research community for over 30 years, one doctor from Harvard would unlock the incredible live-giving secrets behind NR and your body’s NAD level and why he now believes reversing the ageing process is now possible during his lifetime! The bottom line… look feel and perform like you are younger for longer.

<h2>Take care of <strong>your CELLS</strong> and your CELLS will <strong>take care of you!</strong></h2>
Most of us are taking vitamins and supplements to make up for crazy schedules, hurried diets and lack of exercise. We buy them to hopefully slow down aging, stave off disease, look younger, improve heart health, boost immunity, smooth out wrinkles, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, increase energy and lose weight — to name just a few reasons.

And while you’re doing your best, the ONE truth that virtually all doctors and researchers can agree on is that it’s all about your body’s cells! Your body’s cells are responsible for maintaining both <strong>INTERNAL</strong> and <strong>EXTERNAL health</strong>.

<section>Today, we’re going to share exciting news from researchers about an amazing, naturally occurring chemical compound that works deep inside your body — from the inside out — to revitalize and restore your cells.

It's a patented, published and university-tested ingredient that world-renowned doctors and researchers are calling one of the most potent, life-enhancing molecules known today.

<h2><b>Over 100 trillion cells</b> can’t be wrong — or can they?</h2>
Scientists estimate our body is composed of over 100 trillion cells, approximately 2 million of which are dying and about 2 million are being replicated EVERY SECOND! In fact, it is estimated that our entire cell population — all 100 trillion-plus of them — are replaced and replicated every seven years! That’s all fine and well, as long as our body is constantly replicating beautiful, youthful, radiant-looking cells and delaying the aging process. However, if those very same cells have start becoming dysfunctional, unhealthy and not performing up to speed — then the aging process takes hold of you.

<h3>If you’re living, you're losing NAD</h3>
The good news is that we’re all born with an abundant supply of NAD to help us get off to a great start in life. Unfortunately, that supply is relatively short-lived. Almost immediately after we’re born, NAD levels begin dropping at an alarming rate — about 50% for every 20 years of life! If your 40, you have already lost up to 50% of your NAD level TWICE--- an estimated 50% decline by age 20 and another 50% decline by age 40. If this keeps up you could lose another 50% by age 60!!!

And while NAD is present in a few common foods, such as milk, there’s virtually NO WAY for most people to keep up with the body’s relentless demand for NAD to power critical reactions in our bodies. Did you know that COLLAGEN PRODUCTION is NAD dependant? Or that Nectar7 “Niagen” is responsible for driving your bodies NAD levels which power our cells to efficiently burn fats, carbohydrates, sugars and proteins into abundant energy.

<div class="b-nad_doctor l-nad_container">

According to Dr. David Sinclair, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, without adequate levels of NAD in the body, cell health can ultimately suffer allowing the aging process to proceed virtually unimpeded. And as our Niagen levels go — and cell health declines — the door is left wide open for a host of opportunistic diseases to step in. And it all starts at the mitochondria level in our cells.

<h2>How <b>low NAD</b> can scramble <b>CELL</b> communications.</h2>
Just as good, active communication is vital to a healthy relationship, it’s also happens to be the key to cell health. For example, early in a relationship everything may be going swimmingly because communication is heard crystal clear. Over time, however, communication has been known to wane leading to inevitable dysfunction in a relationship.

The same can be said for our cells. When we’re young, our cells are humming along beautifully, NAD levels are HIGH and communication levels are off the charts. When the nucleus (the cell’s quarterback) needs more energy from the mitochondria (the cell’s powerhouse), the request is instantly fulfilled. When we’re young, communication is CRYSTAL CLEAR in our cellular world.

However, as we age, NAD levels DECLINE and the lines of can become frayed. Finally, there comes a time when the nucleus signals the mitochondria for power as usual, but the message is garbled and goes unanswered. Since the mitochondria are responsible for creating more than 90% of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support growth, any dysfunction in communication can lead to a host of age-related diseases.

</div>
<div class="b-nad_disf"><aside class="c-nad_left"><b>Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a wide variety of metabolic, neurodegenerative and age-related diseases such as:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Heart disease</li>
	<li>Diabetes</li>
	<li>Alzheimer’s disease</li>
	<li>Cancers</li>
</ul>
Dr. Sinclair — whose Harvard research is aimed at helping people live healthier, disease-free lives — refers to NAD as the communications molecule between the nucleus and the mitochondria. He’s shown that by increasing NAD levels in laboratory animals, cell communications can actually be restored resulting in YOUNGER and HEALTHIER cells!

<h2>What does <b>NECTAR7 NIAGEN</b> have to do with your body’s <b>NAD levels?</b></h2>
NECTAR7’s Niagen is a proprietary, patented ingredient with FIVE worldwide patents exclusively available from a U.S.-based company. It’s also the first and only commercially available form of nicotinamide riboside (NR) in the world today.
<h3>OK, so how does NECTAR7 NIAGEN impact NAD levels?</h3>
As we mentioned, the only ingredient in NECTAR7’s Niagen is nicotinamide riboside, but it’s a real game-changer. Now here’s the tricky part. We’ve been talking about NAD so far, so where does NECTAR7’s Niagen come in? Well, as Niagen is ingested into the body it’s actually transformed into NAD. And since NR has the ability to literally become another substance — pretty cool trick — it’s considered a precursor. So, NR becomes NAD in your body, which has been shown to play a leading role in helping to stave off aging cells.

<h2>2015 Press Release: Niagen Human Clinical Trial Results</h2>
A single dose of Niagen can restore your NAD levels!
Even as the anti-aging story is being rewritten, you can start restoring your LOW NAD levels right now with a single dose of Niagen from NECTAR7. Here’s proof: In a recent landmark human study conducted by Dr. Charles Brenner at the University of Iowa, one dose of NAD+ was shown to statistically increase the levels of NAD in healthy human volunteers by 30% in just eight hours and even higher with increased dosages!

</section>Unlike so many other products on the market today, NECTAR7’s Niagen doesn’t contain 15 different ingredients, blends and fillers. It contains only ONE ingredient, NR, which has the amazing ability to increase NAD levels in your body. Simply put, Niagen is a naturally occurring, non-flushing form of niacin or Vitamin B3 called Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD). But as you’ll soon learn, NOT all Vitamin B3s are created equal!

<b>Niagen rapidly goes to work at the cellular level and may contribute to a wide range of important health benefits, including increased endurance and energy, and heightened cognitive function. Recent university testing suggests that higher NAD levels may also promote weight loss. </b>

<h2>Seven days that stunned
the <b>scientific community</b></h2>
In October 2013, Dr. David Sinclair published a paper (in association with ChromaDex) in the journal Cell that was not only hailed by his peers in the scientific community, but Time magazine would later name him one of the “100 Most Influential People” in 2014.

Time magazine cited Sinclair’s study in which he and his colleagues identified a cause of aging that is potentially reversible, noting that “his work makes possible the idea of living more years with a body that’s robust enough to make the most of them.”

Here’s what happened. Dr. Sinclair and his team administered an NAD+ booster to 2-year-old mice over seven days. At the end of the week, they examined the animals' biochemical markers (muscle health) to see if there were any measurable differences. To their astonishment, they noted that those 2-year-old mice now boasted the cell attributes of vibrant 6-month-old mice!

<section>
<ul>
	<li>Gave 2-year-old mice an NAD+ booster for just 1 week</li>
	<li>Made the cells resemble those of 6-MONTH-old mice when evaluated for muscle health</li>
	<li>In humans, 60-year-old mitochondria would become the equivalent of a 20-year-old’s</li>
</ul>
Can you imagine? In human terms, that would mean that a 60-year-old would have the mitochondria of a 20-year-old just a week later! Dr. Sinclair had succeeded in turning back the biological clock, or as he explained in more technical terms, “The NAD+ enabled the nucleus to re-establish communication to the mitochondria and the mice went back to being young again.”
